# Incremental Build Support Library

## Introduction

The incremental build support of the Takari lifecycle is available as a generic library to enhance other Maven plugins and tools by enabling incremental builds. We have rewritten this API several times over the last year but the [Takari Lifecycle][1] itself serves as the best, up-to-date, of the current APIs.
