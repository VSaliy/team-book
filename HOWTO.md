# Takari Extensions for Apache Maven TEAM  - Documentation

This is the source code for the documentation for the Takari Extensions for 
Apache Maven TEAM.

# Authoring Content

Source files are in the project root folder as markdown formatted files. 

The Gitbook application can be used for comfortable editing. Alternatively you 
can use the Markdown editor available from the Eclipse marketplace or any other
 markdown editor.

Comments have to be added with  

    [//]: # (test comment)

for each line.

Image inclusions for figures have to follow the naming convention of the 
existing images.
